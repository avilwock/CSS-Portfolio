# Amanda's Portfolio

## Description

This project focuses on a webpage that will be used to display projects that I create, both within and after my bootcamp class.

A wireframe mock-up was created as a blueprint:

Changes were made to the document from the original Wireframing design for usability.

This project will provide an introduction to myself and my work, a recent photo, links to sections within my portfolio, and my projects, initially including my first project. The deployed portfolio will also be viewable and interact with various screens and devices in a responsive manner.

During this project I learned how to better organize my HTML and CSS to condense down my coding, as well as a better understanding of how CSS and HTML interact with one another.

The theme I chose for my portfolio was music, and I included a header with a music theme, as well as several images with musical instruments that will be set up as links to future projects.

I have one active link attached to the image on the first button containing my first projeect, and the rest of the images are placeholders until more projects have been completed and added to my portfolio.

Throughout this project I worked to keep the code condensed and easy to navigate. I added viewport for accessiblity. My Header, Projects, and Contact section are all easy to distinguish within the HTML file. I also provided alts for each image used in this webpage.

My CSS is organized in a way that follows the HTML sheet so that comparisons between the files are easy and accessible. My CSS file is commented on to describe what each section of the style changes in the webpage.

The nav bar at the top of the screen has been styled to change color of the links when hovered over, or when it is active. Otherwise the buttons remain white.

The external links in this pagehave been given different colors for their images, as well as shadows, and a hover feature which changes the opacity of the button when hovered over.

I have designed this device to interact with various screen types for increased accessibility.

I learned several new things regarding flexboxes, media queries, and CSS variables.

In the future I hope to implement more changes to the external link buttons regarding style formatting, and changing the layout from six individual circlular images to a wheel of options. I also hope to implement some JavaScript into my webpage.
